# GhostMapper
To read a little more about DumpDrivers: https://github.com/Oliver-1-1/DumpDriver
## 1.1 Introduction: 
You may or may not have spotted 3 drivers in your Windows system that start with the prefix "dump_". These virtual drivers are special and are often referred to as ghost drivers.
These ghost drivers are used to have a valid and noncorrupted image when a crash happens. When a crash occurs some drivers that need to save data to the disk may be the drivers that caused the crash, therefore
we have a replica of those drivers with the dump_ prefix with the original driver being without the prefix. If we want to save important data to the disk before a crash the ghost drivers can be activated and used.
The ghost drivers are monitored and managed by the crashdmp.sys driver and in that driver are some interesting information that I will take up later.
In reality, the ghost driver is rarely used but could be abused and modified to anyone's liking.

## 1.2 Technical details:
There are ways to create your own dump driver which will later be a ghost driver. It's not well documented by Microsft but there are a few criteria that need to be fulfilled for the driver to be loaded.

* As with any other driver it will need a valid certificate to be loaded.
* The driver entry will take in these arguments with structs that needs to be populated:
DriverEntry(PFILTER_EXTENSION FilterExtension, FILTER_INITIALIZATION_DATA FilterInitialization);
The FilterInitialization struct is supposed the be populated with different callbacks that are used when the crash happens.

  * Dump_Start()

  * Dump_Write()

  * Dump_Read()

  * Dump_Finish() 
  * Dump_Unload()
  
  To read about these callbacks and their use case look in resources[1].

* You will have to register your new driver in the Windows registry. The path is Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl\DumpFilters.
  Be careful when modifying this since it may result in crashdmp.sys attempting to load the driver as a dump driver and crashing the system at boot. Which makes it hard to recover.

This was a simplified version of how the ghost and dump drivers work and I recommend reading this blog[1].

## 1.3 Crashdump.sys:
As stated before all ghost drivers have the same prefix. What if we could somehow patch this prefix before all the ghost drivers are loaded into memory?

With the right signature[2] we could easily patch this out during boot to load our custom-made ghost drivers. Or patch existing ghost drivers since they are inactive. More info on this later.
The result of this could look something like this:

This is of course not enough to be able to hide your driver. All ghost drivers are saved in a linked list in Crashdump.sys. In Crashdump we could find the struct called DUMP_CONTROL_BLOCK which
has a member with the type DUMP_STACK_CONTEXT[3]. In DUMP_STACK_CONTEXT is a linked list with all the dump drivers with their respective file objects.

## 2.1 Code
So I created a mapper of this that will map your driver inside one of these ghost drivers. This will result in you having a driver in signed memory.

The mapper code is taken from xigmapper since this is just a POC and is to show the concept. Since the page protection does not match with your driver I changed the pte to the appropriate protection to be
able to run the driver. So .text section will have nx = false and rw = false; .data section will have nx=true and rw=true;
I start out with zeroing out the whole driver to prevent bugs then I patch in my driver and change page protection.

This can easily be combined with a boot mapper and that way you could implement what's suggested in section 1.3.
